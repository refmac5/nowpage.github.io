    <p><b>What I am doing now.</b></p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>I am in Greensboro, North Carolina, and this is what I spend my time
      doing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Working on one topic of basic science and trying to publish it.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Collaborating with researchers in the field and contributing my value.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning my second molecular dynamics language.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Writing/reading 2 h in the morning on research stuff and trying to
        help create my values in science.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Running an active biochemistry research lab where I mentor two juniors
        in chemistry major.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Teaching 400 biochemistry and biochemistry lab on a regular base</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning French, Spanish and Japanese.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Going to the gym for weight lifting class once a week.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    So, everything else in life became a much lower priority.<br>
